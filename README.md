## Future Development 

- Currently only one gif can be saved to local storage. In the future, code could be added to create a list of saved gifs instead of only one favorite.

- The background is currently an image of Seattle's skyline. A change that could be implemented is add another API to retrieve an image of the searched city and set the background to that.
